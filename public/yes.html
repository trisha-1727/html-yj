    <h3>I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu ;)</h3>
    <p>Listen to me, okay? I’m in love with you. I love you every second of the day. And I’ve never loved anyone as I love you. I cry over you not because I’m in pain but because I feel so blessed that I just can’t hide my emotions. You are on my mind every moment. I’ve never missed anyone as I miss you. You are someone special to me. Please be with me forever and ever.</p>
    <p>When I met you, you were my best friend. But the more I saw you smile, the deeper I fell in love with you. You showed me that true happiness is having a person by your side who accepts you in all your moods, stays through all your ups and downs, and never lets you go, regardless of the hardships. I love you and will do so for the rest of my life.</p>
